For the past few months, I have been assigned a project to create a brand new web page that is about myself. The purpose of this project is to learn and display the new features and skills that I have learned so far. Throughout each week, I have learned something new about HTML and CSS. So far, I have learned how to use html and css, create headers, add colors for backgrounds and outlines, add images and videos, add and edit different fonts and font sizes, make items responsive, and create contact forms and nav bars. Learning HTML and CSS can be a valuable skill to have, especially in today's world where the internet plays such a big role in our daily lives, and it can open up a lot of opportunities for people, as it is a crucial skill for anyone looking to enter the world of web development. It's a valuable skill to have, and with the right resources and dedication, anyone can learn it. Overall, completing this project and learning HTML and CSS has been a rewarding experience and I am very glad that I chose to learn the basics of these useful skills.

The colors that I have chosen and used for this project are:
