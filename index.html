<h2>Hobbies:</h2>

<p>My current hobbies include playing soccer, running, and playing video games. I started playing soccer when I was 8 and I have enjoyed playing it ever since. I have played for many clubs and I even played in high school. I started going on runs my freshman year of high school so that I could get fit for soccer. I usually try to run at least 3 times a week but in the summer I try to run everyday. I don’t actually enjoy running, but I enjoy the feeling after finishing a run. I have played video games for as long as I can remember. When I was growing up, my dad had a Playstation 3 and I would always play games with him such as Fifa and Halo. Now I play new games with my friends and we all have a good time. My favorite games to play currently are Fifa, Call of Duty, Valorant, and Grand Theft Auto.</p>

<h2>Image Hover Effects</h2>

<div>

    <p>Image hover effects are a popular technique used in modern web design where an image or other visual element changes in some way when the user hovers their cursor over it. This can be a subtle effect, such as a slight change in color or a simple animation, or it can be a more noticeable transformation, such as an image flipping or sliding to reveal additional content.

        Hover effects are typically created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the goal of making the website or application more interactive and engaging for the user. In HTML, the basic structure of a hover effect might involve a div element containing the image, along with some additional HTML elements to hold the additional content that will be revealed on hover.
        
        The CSS is then used to style the elements and create the desired hover effect. For example, the initial state of the image might be set to have a certain opacity or be positioned a certain way, and then on hover the CSS could specify a transition to make the image become more opaque or move to a new position.
        
        JavaScript can also be used to add more advanced hover effects, such as animations or other dynamic changes to the image. For instance, a JavaScript function could be used to listen for the hover event and then trigger a specific animation or change to the image when it occurs.
        
        One popular example of a hover effect is the "zoom" effect, where an image appears to grow larger and more detailed on hover. This can be achieved using a combination of CSS and JavaScript, where the initial state of the image is set to be smaller and lower resolution, and then on hover the JavaScript function triggers a transition to make the image grow and switch to a higher resolution version.
        
        Another common hover effect is the "reveal" effect, where additional content is revealed when the user hovers over the image. This could be a text caption, a button, or some other element that was previously hidden. The reveal effect is often achieved using a combination of absolute positioning and transitions in CSS, where the additional content is positioned off-screen initially and then moved into view on hover.
        
        In conclusion, image hover effects are a useful tool for web designers and developers looking to add interactivity and engagement to their websites or applications. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is possible to create a wide range of hover effects, from subtle color changes to more advanced animations and reveals. These effects can help make a website or application more engaging and user-friendly, and can be a great way to add a touch of personality and polish to any digital project.</p>
